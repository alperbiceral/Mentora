## Description
Mentora is a personalized assistant for students to help on their study sessions. It aims to solve the problems students face: Irregular sleep patterns, loss of motivation, inconsistent study habits, and emotional stress. Mentora helps students by analyzing biological rhythm, student’s emotional situation, exam calendar, student personality, student’s academic history and course schedule. It follows Pomodoro technique to make students more focused, offers physical and breathing exercises to enhance both mental and physical well-being.

To understand the user’s mental situation, Mentora uses emotion detection and natural language processing (NLP). It analyzes facial expressions and written feedback related to the user’s emotion. It also uses psychological profiling tools like TIPI (Ten Item Personality Inventory) and the Five-Factor Personality Model (OCEAN) to characterize the system. For example, if a student is identified as easily bored or high in stress, the system can offer relieving activities or emotional support features depending on their needs.

Mentora helps students with their academic planning. It analyzes past grades, current semester’s workload, and the number of exams to understand how difficult the course is for each student. This information can be gathered from the documents students upload. If major assignments are approaching, it sends a notification and updates the study plan accordingly. In the weeks that has more workload, it recommends starting earlier. 

After each week, Mentora collects feedback from the user with a form so that it can learn. The questions that are going to be asked are “How was your week?”, “Did you reach your goals?”, and “What could be better?”. Based on these answers, Mentora reanalyzes the student and reschedules the study plan for the upcoming weeks.
